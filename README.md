## 🎯 The Challenge We're Tackling

**Real-World Scenario**: Every day, thousands of people apply for loans. Banks need to make quick, accurate decisions about who gets approved and who doesn't.

**The Stakes Are High**:
- ❌ **Approve bad loans**: Banks lose money to defaults
- ❌ **Reject good applicants**: Banks lose business and may perpetuate inequality
- ✅ **Get it right**: Everyone wins - responsible lending, fair access

**Our Mission**: Build AI that makes fair, accurate, and explainable loan decisions.
